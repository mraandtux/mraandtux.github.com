<h1>The Landlord</h1><u>Just my 2 cents here.</u><br><br>
My male landlord may occasionaly reply me in Mandarin, even if I speak Cantonese. Thus I have to reply in King's Diddily  - English language that is, to decrease the use of Mandarin language in Canton (the Chinese city, not American). <br><br>
But here's the catch: my male landlord could not understand English at all. I can use Cantonese too, but I want to push the Anglisation in the country to let Beijing knows they should not go with this "Mandarin Domination" thing anymore.<br><br>
Sometimes I just can't stand my male landlord over his use of Mandarin. At one time I gave him the finger and using the F word, and he still didn't understand why I did that to him. My parents don't want me go further, but I have no choice but to retaliate. At one time I prevent him leaving for a few minutes, just to make sure he never did it again. And he did until recently.<br><br>
There's a lot of people like him now, ignoring the fact that you can still use Cantonese instead of Mandarin when they both good at Cantonese! We have to stop the Mandarinisation trend in Cantonese-speaking communities, once and for all!<br><br>
