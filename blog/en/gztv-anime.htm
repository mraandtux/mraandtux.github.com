<p>The Guangzhou Broadcasting Network is getting nerdier. Or is it? But if it is, they won't admit it. As about 2008, when the Vocaloid hit <em>Ievan Polkka</em> started to being heard nationally through radio and TV, and eventually played in halftime period during the 2010 Asian Games, the network's prime time newscast has been added two sketches-based segments, one satires social issues, one teaching Cantonese culture. And both segments are filled with background music and chatter - some of these music is from an anime. After I watch these segments and the animes which the segments' music used from, I decided to tell the people about it. Since these segments got cancelled, these soundtracks can be heard on both regular and showbiz news, even the "on the road" segments where reporters discover traditional culture, community events and leisure spots across Guangzhou and beyond. Sounds like a soft news magazine. But not just these: an instrumental version of the Vocaloid hit "Senbon Sakura" was played during <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mraandtux/mraandtux.github.com/releases/download/1/gztv-sakura.mp4">a holiday recommendations report</a>; the theme of <i>Attack on Titan</i> is played in background on another news bulletin of the network, when the series is still airing in Japan.</p>
<p>Back to '08, there's also <a href="http://www.sosg.net/read.php?tid=190697">discussions about this issue on the web</a> (Chinese link), and still continuing through social media ever since. But no one at the network is have their words say. Until 2013.</p>
<p>A reporter of the network told me that playing background music in a news item may implies opinions. And its prime time news host, Kelvin Wong Ka-yan (he covers St Seiya's theme when the news team is promoting at a theme park after he replied me), says "It's OK to put any music into news as an 'enhancing tool' to express feelings of the editor". Agree him? Not me, because he's not just defending its news editors itself, but other networks which also used anime music as they played in background.</p>
<p>These anime soundtracks are used by the network's local news bulletins in various times, heard by me, which can be found at YouTube, SoundCloud, or other sites with a help from search engine.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although the network's case is just a tip of an iceberg, meaning more networks is joining the line-up of using anime and game soundtracks from background, until those from network does <b>not</b> know the origin of the soundtrack, their thoughts and their standards, the nerds will not stop talking about it - and <b>this will be going on forever</b>.</p></html>
